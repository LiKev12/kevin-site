        <p>
        I'm a Bachelor's/Master's student at Washington University in St. Louis studying Computer Science. 
        I graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering in May 2019, and am expected to finish my MS in Computer Science in May 2020.
        Besides creating new apps and solving interesting problems, I enjoy playing chess, tennis, and board games (Avalon!) with friends. 
        Some recent hobbies include marathon training and, to cancel it out, baking desserts.
